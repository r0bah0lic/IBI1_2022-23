This was my first time using github, and I thought it was very difficult at first, especially when git push or dealing with branches often had problems, I had to search for many solutions online, which made me very impatient. But as I got to know github, I found it very interesting. I decorated my homepage to make it personal and beautiful (you can check it out, I think it looks great). I also found github very convenient and I use github a lot now
